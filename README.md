Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. 

Group Member Name(s): Miriam Pennock

Other collaborators you worked with, including TAs (and feel free to give a shoutout to anyone who was particularly helpful): None this week!

Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials:

I used some stackoverflow to try to figure out some bugs, but nothing else. 

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

I enjoyed this assignment, although I certainly found it challenging. I think I learned lots of new, simpler ways to handle different things in code (like peek() and pop() are awesome), and I feel like I have a good understanding of ArrayDeque. It was a fun assignment to think about and tackle. Also, I think I understand gradle now!

This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else?

I drew some things out on a whiteboard, but I erased it to work on another assignment before I saw this, so unfortunately I'm not uploading any pseudocode.
